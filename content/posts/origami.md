I visited an exhibition of Origami in Thane. It was organized by the Origami Thane group. Origami groupâ€™s intention to involve students into craft so that they become creative and stay away from the addiction to mobile phones.

Few things about Origami
<br/>

+ Ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper"
+ Associated Japanese culture
+ Folding paper to transform into a finished sculpture
